This is an to practice traversing a linked list. Given a pointer to the head node of a linked list, print each node's  element, one per line. If the head pointer is null (indicating the list is empty), there is nothing to print.

Function Description:
* Complete the printLinkedList function in the editor below.
* printLinkedList has the following parameter(s):
* SinglyLinkedListNode head: a reference to the head of the list

Print:
* For each node, print its  value on a new line (console.log in Javascript).
Input Format
* The first line of input contains , the number of elements in the linked list.
* The next  lines contain one element each, the  values for each node.

Note: Do not read any input from stdin/console. Complete the printLinkedList function in the editor below.
